## News client challenge

Create a CLI program, using Node.js, to display news from sources. You should be able to specify how many news you want per source

The solution should be easily scalable. Meaning it should be as easy as possible to add a new source.
The program should ask you which approach you'd like to use out of 2:

- All at once - Collecting all news from all sources first, and only after that it displays them. The news should be grouped by source.
- Iterator - Displaying news as they become available using the iterator pattern. The news are not grouped by source
